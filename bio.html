    <div class="bio-text">
    <p>Orlan Ghekiere (1999) has a strong love for sound and its endless possibilities. 
    He experimented a lot with different types of sound and is interested in a broad variety of music making.</p>
    <p>As a recently graduated jazz drummer at the conservatory of Antwerp he has been constantly on the hunt for new experiences. Besides the 
    usual jazz-influenced drumming and playing concerts in different musical settings, styles and setups, he 
    developed a love for electronic music. The magical world of synthesizers, DAWs and music production engulfed 
    him in their practice.</p>
    <p>
    Orlan tries to break the barrier between natural day to day sound and music. Field Recordings and electronic 
    improvisations blend into one big entity, recognizable sounds get assigned a new unrecognizable context which 
    creates a tactile yet abstract space. Live, these explorations are met with acoustic drums. That’s how, while 
    improvising, an extra texture is woven into that sound bath. The search continues in a physical manner.</p>
